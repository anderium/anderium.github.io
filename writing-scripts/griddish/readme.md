Doped as griddish by the community, “grid alphabet” is a syllabic script.

Check out a font for this script by u/pomdepin published on [Overleaf][griddish-font]!

It works great for magic circles, as @JacksonEflin on Twitter shows!

1. With straight edges:
  “As above so below” ([source][magic-circle-1])
  ![The text before, written in griddish four times to form a circle.][magic-circle-1-img]
2. And with rounded corners:
  “I have as many genders as there are ways to die” ([source][magic-circle-2])
  ![The text before, written in griddish to form a circle.][magic-circle-2-img]
