# Python numpy shape-typing

One thing that I have fallen in love with, is Python typing.  Yes, I know Python is supposed to be an untyped language,
but that doesn't mean it doesn't have types.  In fact, it's very useful to know whether something is an integer, or a
list if you want to repeat another thing based on this.  Python typing is a non-strict way to describe the parameters
and return type of a function or script variables.  It's useful for humans because they understand what they should
provide and your IDE can give you suggestions based on what you may enter.

Numpy is a package for Python for **num**erical computations.  It provides efficient implementations for arrays, matrix
multiplications and many other things.  You can already see where this is going, because you obviously want to also add
type-hints to functions that work on matrices.  For instance the normal matrix multiplication requires the inner
dimensions of its operands to be equal ($\mathbf A\mathbf B=\mathbf C, \mathbf A\in\mathbb R^{N\times M},\mathbf B\in
\mathbb R^{M\times K},\mathbf C\in\mathbb R^{N\times K}$).  Unfortunately it's difficult to find a useful way to add
type hints that account for operations that add or remove a number of rows from an array.  In fact it may be impossible
for statically inferring everything, because that would probably lead to the ability to program with the type hints,
something that seems really weird.

The reason I made this page is that I was looking into this anyway for answering a question on a private forum after it
piqued my interest.  (And I needed a place to put the text below so it wouldn't get lost to time.)
