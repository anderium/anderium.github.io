# anderium's site

Welcome to my GitHub Pages site, where I might put all kinds of things I do, learn, or want to share.  I've got no clue
how Pages works and I'm not going to use this often enough to learn every bit there is to it.  If there's anything I
can improve, this is a public repo, so you can submit a PR and I'll take a look.

As I'm interested in lots of unrelated things, I'll list the things I have pages for here.

* [Ergonomic keyboards and keyboard layouts](./keyboards/readme.md),
* [The constructed language toki pona](./toki-pona/readme.md)
* [The esoteric programming language brainfuck](./brainfuck/readme.md)

Most subdirectories will probably not have anything in common, but you can obviously still visit them all by looking at
the directories I have.  Some might not be in English though, I'm inactively learning Toki Pona and natively speak
Dutch.

**Disclaimer:** I don't really know how to write blogs, so things you read here might be pretty bad.  I definitely
believe the introductory pages could be improved a lot, but since I mostly created these to have a place to link to
their children that hasn't taken priority.
