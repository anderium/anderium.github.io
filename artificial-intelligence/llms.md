# LLMs

LLMs see English text way more as a logographic language like Chinese, they don't really know what it means for words to
be made up of characters.  I do remember reading that ChatGPT has both tokenized and character attention heads, but
the few times I've used it it felt like it doesn't actually understand what it means for words to be made of letters
from an alphabet.
