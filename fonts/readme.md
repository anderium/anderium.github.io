# Fonts

List of fonts that I like.

## Favourite fonts

### Fira Code

Font with programming ligatures.  My main monospace font everywhere that I can use it.

## Shavian language

This is actually a subsection on fonts I've never used, but I wanted to select the ones that looked the nicest to my
untrained eye before learning Shavian.

The first three from [Shavian.info] itself, the next from [Inter Alia], and the other four from [2gd4me].

### Ormin

Probably actually a nice serif Shavian font for reading text in.

### Cafe Majestic Inline

For titles.

#### Cafe Majestic Regular

Said to be good for comics, and I think I agree?  I don't see why I'd ever use it, though.

### Inter Alia

Made for interfaces, has support for 6 additional characters that did not make it into Unicode.

### 𐑦𐑥𐑐𐑦𐑑𐑩𐑕 / Impetus

Based on Impact, which is apparently THE meme font.

### 𐑒𐑩𐑯𐑕𐑦𐑕𐑑𐑩𐑯𐑕𐑦 / Consistency

> Consistency Shavian is an unofficial extension of the font Computer Modern Serif.

### 𐑛𐑧𐑒𐑕𐑰𐑤𐑾 / Dexelia

Instead of making the Shavian characters look like Latin characters this goes the other way around, which makes it a
very nice font to look at English letters differently.,

### 𐑲𐑴𐑑𐑩𐑕𐑦𐑟𐑩𐑥 #43 / Iotacism #43 Linked

Typewriter like variant where some vowels have been separated into two characters to bring it down from 48 to 43.  The
Linked variant of this font connects these “compound vowels” so they look like two wide characters.
